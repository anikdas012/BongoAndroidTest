Both Car and Plane class implements Vehicle interface. Which means Vehicle is a supper class of both of them. The VehicleFactory class creates an instance of the Car or Plane class according to provided vehicle type. As both classes are sub-class of Vehicle so the supper class (Vehicle) can be used as the type of either class. But while calling a method from an object of vehicle type the method will be called from the actual call (either Plane or Car) because of Polymorphism. This way we can create an instance of either Plane or Car class without knowing how to create the instance by using VehicleFactory. So the actual implementation of object creation is hidden from the user.
